A mini flutter reddit client, just for learning purpose
(I have no idea what I'm doing :/)

## The App
- Browse /r/popular
- Allowed to change subreddit
- Display post content (does not work with cross posts)
- Display comments recursively (but not every comments, there is no "load more" yet)
- Open in browser
